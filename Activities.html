        <p>We have Monday and Tuesday afternoon weekday opportunities for students. We also have ADULT TRAFFIC
            opportunities and some set up and break down volunteer slots as we get busy into the holiday season. Our
            weekend volunteer opportunities are on SATURDAY MORNINGS from 8:00 am - 11:30 am. We hope you can join us
            on Saturday mornings as we serve the food-insecure community with dignity.</p>

        <p>As the holidays are arriving, our line typically grows and we need your help. We are looking for
            organizations willing to do food drives and also decorate our grocery bags. Please reach out to
            CatalystChange@gmail.com</p>

        <p>We welcome anyone who has time during the week to help us Monday - Thursday between the hours of 9:30 am
            and 1:30 pm (it does not have to be a full shift - see below) as we navigate sorting donations, stocking
            shelves, and making grocery bags for our clients. Bring a friend before going out to lunch, come after
            your morning coffee or workout, or choose a day of the week that you can commit to possibly once per week
            or month. Our Monday and Thursday morning volunteer spots from 9:30 am - 12:30 pm require our most need.
